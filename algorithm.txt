### Key Algorithm: Ray Casting for 3D Rendering

1. **Initialization**:
   - The screen is defined with a width of 120 columns and a height of 40 rows.
   - The world map is a 16x16 grid where `#` represents a wall, and `.` represents open space.
   - The player starts at a specific position (`fPlayerX`, `fPlayerY`) with an initial rotation angle (`fPlayerA`).
   - The player's field of view (`fFOV`) and the maximum rendering distance (`fDepth`) are set.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The game runs in a continuous loop, constantly updating the player's position and the screen based on user input.
   - Time is calculated between frames (`fElapsedTime`) to ensure consistent movement speed, even if the frame rate changes.

3. **Player Controls**:
   - The player can rotate left (`A`) or right (`D`), which changes `fPlayerA`.
   - The player can move forward (`W`) or backward (`S`), which changes `fPlayerX` and `fPlayerY`. Collision detection prevents the player from moving through walls.

4. **Ray Casting**:
   - For each column of the screen, a ray is cast into the world to determine what the player sees in that direction.
   - The angle of the ray (`fRayAngle`) is calculated based on the player's current rotation and field of view.
   - The ray is incrementally extended (`fStepSize`) until it hits a wall (`bHitWall`) or reaches the maximum depth (`fDepth`).

5. **Wall Detection**:
   - The ray checks each grid cell it passes through. If it hits a wall (`#`), it stops, and the distance to the wall is recorded.
   - To add detail, the algorithm checks for boundaries between wall blocks and shades them differently if detected.

6. **Rendering**:
   - The screen is divided into three sections: ceiling, wall, and floor.
   - The height of the wall on the screen is calculated based on the distance from the player. Closer walls appear taller, and distant walls appear shorter.
   - The walls are shaded based on distance, with closer walls appearing brighter.
   - The floor is shaded with a gradient that fades as it gets closer to the horizon.

7. **Output**:
   - The final rendered scene is written to the screen buffer, which is then displayed on the console.

### Summary of the Algorithm
The core algorithm is ray casting, which simulates a 3D perspective on a 2D grid. By casting rays from the player's position and determining where they intersect with walls, the engine constructs a 3D view of the environment. The use of shading and boundary detection adds realism to the rendered scene, simulating lighting effects.

This approach is computationally simple, making it suitable for running in real-time even in a basic console environment. The code uses basic trigonometry and linear algebra to calculate the ray intersections and screen rendering, ensuring that the scene looks realistic from the player's perspective.
